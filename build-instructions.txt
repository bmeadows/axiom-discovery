Requires SWI-Prolog (version 6 or higher) to run.

The framework is contained in the main file 'qlearningwithRRL_foraffordances_new.pl'. Rules and facts from other .pl files are included according to the parameterization given in this file.

To run, first modify the first 100 lines of the main file to set these and other parameters as appropriate. This should include loading a file describing the test domain, such as 'domain_blocks_new.pl' or 'domain_butler_new.pl'.

(The file 'domain_butler_new.pl' is configured to learn failure cases for one particular action, and must be reconfigured to find constraints for other actions.)

To begin learning, consult the main file with SWI-Prolog (swipl.exe).

Enter

     run('filename').

to begin processing.

A batch processing interface is available using

    runbatch('counterFilename', 'errorFilename', 'timeFilename').

which can be run multiple times updating the run data that is stored in the output files each time.

Additional domain-specific files are included providing functionality to determine the proportion of bad output constraints that are overspecifications of ground truth constraints to those that are genuine errors.

These are 'analysis-rb-serve', 'analysis-rb-pickup', and 'analysis-bw'.
