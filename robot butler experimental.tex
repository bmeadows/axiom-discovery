\subsection{Robot Butler}

In the RB domain, the robot has to travel to the location of a person who 
has no beverage and serve them a drink. As described in Section~3, 
\textit{move} actions move the robot between rooms, while \textit{serve} 
actions result in a person at the robot's location to have a beverage. 
Continuing for one hour (six actions), or serving both people,
