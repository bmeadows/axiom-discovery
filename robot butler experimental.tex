% Section 4.2, `Simple Mario'

\subsection{Robot Butler}

In the RB domain, the robot has to travel to the location of a person who 
has no beverage and serve them a drink. As described in Section~3, 
\textit{move} actions move the robot between rooms, while \textit{serve} 
actions result in a person at the robot's location to have a beverage. 
Continuing for one hour (six actions), failing to serve a drink, or serving 
both people, terminates the episode.

As well as the domain objects being in different locations, scenarios in the RB 
domain can vary by a number of attributes. 
Each person has one of three different \textit{roles} and each location is one 
of four different types of \textit{room}. The scenario can take place either 
\textit{early} or \textit{late} in the week. 
The objective of the robot butler is to serve drinks to the people in a way 
that will not result in episode termination -- any such unexpected termination 
triggers RRL for discovering axioms.
