% Section 4.2, `Simple Mario'

\subsection{Robot Butler}

In the RB domain, the robot has to travel to the location of a person who 
has no beverage and serve them a drink. As described in Section~3, 
\textit{move} actions move the robot between rooms, while \textit{serve} 
actions result in a person at the robot's location to have a beverage. 
Continuing for one hour (six actions), failing to serve a drink, or serving 
both people, terminates the episode.

As well as the domain objects being in different locations, scenarios in the RB 
domain can vary by a number of attributes. 
Each person has one of three different \textit{roles} and each location is one 
of four different types of \textit{room}. The scenario can take place either 
\textit{early} or \textit{late} in the week. 
The objective of the robot butler is to serve drinks to the people in a way 
that will not result in episode termination -- any such unexpected termination 
triggers RRL for discovering axioms.

To evaluate...

List at least three generalized axioms...

The rules generated specify...


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I've
- updated the axiom discovery file; all yours
- added the blocks world convergence plot `Convergence-data-BW' to the repository
- added examples of target axioms to `robot butler domain description.tex'; all yours
- split off a new file, `robot butler experimental.tex' that I'm still working on

Next I'll
- put together a plot comparing convergence over the robot butler domain, add that to the repository
- keep working on the experimental setup/results text
- get actual axiom results!
- get some data on memory costs / complexity for RRL vs QL

Note: Prolog 1 and 2 just have the `manager/week' failure; Prolog 3 and 4 just have the `workshop location' failure.

--- examples of axioms that the butler domain actually generates

should be `manager'

How about `only in the kitchen'?
Next tests are for that.

1. Grab data I know is from RRL robot domain, put it in a bunch of columns, try it out on copy of worksheet
2. Do QL for robot domain, look at data there



1. I can find convergence patterns in the files - exactly ten 10s (or whatever) in a row!!
Can pad from there!!!!
2. Maybe problem is it thinks convergence is hitting, early... Try extending to a huge number and trying again!
